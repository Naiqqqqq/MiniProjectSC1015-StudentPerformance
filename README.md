# MiniProjectSC1015-StudentPerformance

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015.

### Problem Statement
How can we help students improve their learning proficiency in their respective mother tongue?

### Motivation
Singapore is a multicultural society with a bilingual policy that emphasises the importance of being proficient in both English and oneâ€™s mother tongue. Besides language proficiency, it is also about preserving cultural identity and heritage. Being fluent in our mother tongue can also help us communicate effectively with our grandparents, or the older generation who are not fluent in English. Research has also shown that being proficient  in one's mother tongue has multiple benefits. On top of boosting overall academic performance, it also improves cognitive abilities, delays the onset of dementia and enhances an individual's memory.
