# MiniProjectSC1015-StudentPerformance

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015.

### Problem Statement
How can we help students improve their learning proficiency in their respective mother tongue?

### Motivation
Singapore is a multicultural society with a bilingual policy that emphasises the importance of being proficient in both English and one’s mother tongue. Besides language proficiency, it is also about preserving cultural identity and heritage. Being fluent in our mother tongue can also help us communicate effectively with our grandparents, or the older generation who are not fluent in English. Research has also shown that being proficient in one's mother tongue has multiple benefits. On top of boosting overall academic performance, it also improves cognitive abilities, delays the onset of dementia and enhances an individual's memory. 

### Data Set

### Conclusion
- Overall, as a solution, parents or teachers can predict their student or child’s results and also see which areas are affecting their grades. Thereafter, they can help them to achieve better grades.  
###### Data Driven Insights
Top three variables that are affecting a student’s grades:  
1. Failures  
  - As past failures greatly affect a student’s results, parents or teachers can intervene earlier to help the student build a strong foundation.  
2. Absences  
  - We feel that students must be responsible for their own attendance, be it they have other activites or the are sick, they should refrain from missing school as much as possible  
3. Desire for higher education  
  - Parents and teachers can help to change the mindset of students who do not desire a higher education and find out the reason behind it. As this is one of the major factors affecting their results.
